# odin-recipes
Pre-project:

The goal of this project is to put all the html knowledge ive learned to the test. I will be attempting to create a recipe webpage from scratch. I feel pretty comfortable with the actual code of html and basic navigation using the terminal. I am not, however, comfortable with git or github, esspecially using git via the terminal, i.e. adding and pushing saves to github.

Post-project:
